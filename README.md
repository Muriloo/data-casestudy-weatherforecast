## User Story

As Head of Merchanside Planning (MP), I want to use Weather Forecast Data to make decisions on consumer product demand for the next 7 days. Therefore I need a new table in our data warehouse with following information: 

 - city, 
 - date, 
 - minimun_temperature, and
 - maximum_temperature.

The MP team reviewed this Weather API https://darksky.net/dev/docs and it fits our needs. Data for the following cities is avaiable in the data warehouse:
 - **SÃ£o Paulo**:  latitude: -23.55052, longitude-46.633309 
 - **Rio de Janeiro**:  latitude: -22.9035, longitude -43.2096


## Guidelines
-   Create your own repository to push your application there and share it with AMARO
-   Write down the main guidelines to use your system on the Readme file.


## Advise
You are the owner of this application, so feel free to define **any** technical details and implementations by yourself; but know the "why"! Help the Merchandise Planning team to get meaningful outputs. 

Note that we believe we believe in the zen of python principles [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/).

  Review your work as we might ask questions about it:

1.  How and where would you deploy the application?
2.  It is ok to build a quick and smart solution which might include technical debts: Do you see any technical debts?
3.  Did you enjoy the task? If yes or no, why?
4.  What did you learn? What went good? Where did you have challenges?
5. What user use cases do you see to use this data?
